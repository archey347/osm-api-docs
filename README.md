# OSM API Docs

Unofficial, community-driven OpenAPI documentation for
the [Online Scout Manager](https://www.onlinescoutmanager.co.uk) (OSM) API — reverse-engineered from real traffic by the
City of Newcastle Scouts Digital Team.

OSM doesn't publish a public API specification. This project exists to fill that gap for developers building tools on
top of OSM's platform, whether you're writing a custom badge tracker, a patrol planner, or anything else that helps
leaders run their sections.

> [!WARNING]
> **This documentation is provided as-is with no guarantees.** OSM's API is undocumented and can change without notice.
> Endpoints, parameters, and response shapes described here were observed at the time of writing and may drift over time.

## What's covered

The spec documents **19 endpoints** across 9 categories, with request/response examples and schemas:

| `openapi.yaml` | OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification — the source of truth    |
| `index.html`   | Interactive docs UI (Redoc) — just open in a browser |

## Viewing the docs

Open `index.html` in any browser. It loads `openapi.yaml` into [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) for a
searchable, nicely formatted reference with request/response examples.

You can also import `openapi.yaml` into tools like [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/), Postman, or Insomnia.

## Key things to know

- **Authentication** — OSM uses OAuth 2.0. You'll need a `client_id` and `client_secret` from OSM. The bearer token goes
  in the `Authorization` header. Tokens expire and must be refreshed via the `/oauth/token` endpoint.

- **Response format quirks** — Some endpoints return JavaScript (`var data_holder = {...}`) rather than clean JSON.
  You'll need to strip the prefix before parsing. The `startup` endpoint is the main offender.

- **POST bodies** — OSM expects `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for all POST requests, **not** JSON. Sending JSON
  will get you blocked.

- **Rate limits** — OSM enforces rate limits. Responses may include `X-RateLimit-*` or `RateLimit-*` headers. If you hit
  a `429`, back off immediately. Excessive requests will get your OAuth client banned.

- **Privacy and GDPR** — These endpoints return personal data about young people and their families. Handle it
  responsibly. Don't store what you don't need, don't log PII, and follow your organisation's data protection policies.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome — especially for endpoints not yet documented. If you've observed a new endpoint or spotted a mistake:

1. Add or update the relevant path in `openapi.yaml`
2. Include realistic but **fictional** example data (no real names, IDs, or section data)
3. Note any quirks in the description (unusual response formats, required-but-undocumented params, etc.)
